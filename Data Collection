SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Lab 1: Collecting the Data
Estimated time needed: 45 minutes
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API.

Objectives

Request to the SpaceX API

Clean the requested data

# Requests allows us to make HTTP requests which we will use to get data from an API
import requests
# Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas as pd
# NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
import numpy as np
# Datetime is a library that allows us to represent dates
import datetime

# Setting this option will print all collumns of a dataframe
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
# Setting this option will print all of the data in a feature
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
